known issues:
while rebuilding archive, connection can reset and cause one or multiple scps to not be retrieved from the website
while browsing the pictures in pictures directory, an error can be thrown saying there is an error reading the file, no known reason
some photos are just white instead of the intended picture
app must restart after rebuilding archive due to a multi-threading side effect where it creates an SCP instance and inserts it out of order into the scpList, restarting the app and building it without the web fixes this issue
